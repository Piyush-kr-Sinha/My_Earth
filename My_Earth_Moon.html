            <p>
                Moon, Earth's sole natural satellite and nearest large celestial body. Known since prehistoric times, it is the brightest object in the sky after the Sun. It is designated by the symbol ☽. Its name in English, like that of Earth, is of Germanic and Old
                English derivation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Earth's moon is 2,159 miles (3,474 km) wide, about one fourth of Earth's diameter. Our planet has one moon, while Mercury and Venus have none and all the other planets in our solar system have two or more.</p>

            <p> The leading explanation for how Earth's moon formed is that a giant impact knocked the raw ingredients for the moon off the primitive, molten Earth and into orbit. Scientists have suggested that the object that hit the planet had roughly 10%
                the mass of Earth — about the size of Mars.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. At about one-quarter the diameter of Earth (comparable to the width of Australia),[16] it is the largest natural satellite in the Solar System relative to the size of a major planet,[f] the fifth largest satellite
                in the Solar System overall, and larger than any known dwarf planet. The Moon is a planetary-mass object that formed a differentiated rocky body, making it a satellite planet under the geophysical definitions of the term.[17] It lacks
                any significant atmosphere, hydrosphere, or magnetic field. Its surface gravity is about one-sixth of Earth's (0.1654 g); Jupiter's moon Io is the only satellite in the Solar System known to have a higher surface gravity and density.</p>


            <p> Orbiting Earth at an average distance of 384,400 km (238,900 mi),[18] or about 30 times Earth's diameter, its gravitational influence slightly lengthens Earth's day and is the main driver of Earth's tides. The Moon's orbit around Earth has
                a sidereal period of 27.3 days. During each synodic period of 29.5 days, the amount of visible surface illuminated by the Sun varies from none up to 100%, resulting in lunar phases that form the basis for the months of a lunar calendar.
                The Moon is tidally locked to Earth, which means that the length of a full rotation of the Moon on its own axis causes its same side (the near side) to always face Earth, and the somewhat longer lunar day is the same as the synodic period.
                That said, 59% of the total lunar surface can be seen from Earth through shifts in perspective due to libration.[19]</p>


            <p> The most widely accepted origin explanation posits that the Moon formed about 4.51 billion years ago, not long after Earth, out of the debris from a giant impact between the planet and a hypothesized Mars-sized body called Theia. It then receded
                to a wider orbit because of tidal interaction with the Earth. The near side of the Moon is marked by dark volcanic maria ("seas"), which fill the spaces between bright ancient crustal highlands and prominent impact craters. Most of the
                large impact basins and mare surfaces were in place by the end of the Imbrian period, some three billion years ago. The lunar surface is relatively non-reflective, with a reflectance just slightly brighter than that of worn asphalt. However,
                because it has a large angular diameter, the full moon is the brightest celestial object in the night sky. The Moon's apparent size is nearly the same as that of the Sun, allowing it to cover the Sun almost completely during a total solar
                eclipse.</p>


            <p> Both the Moon's prominence in the earthly sky and its regular cycle of phases have provided cultural references and influences for human societies throughout history. Such influences can be found in language, calendar systems, art, and mythology.
                The first artificial object to reach the Moon was the Soviet Union's Luna 2 uncrewed spacecraft in 1959; this was followed by the first successful soft landing by Luna 9 in 1966. The only human lunar missions to date have been those of
                the United States' Apollo program, which landed twelve men on the surface between 1969 and 1972. These and later uncrewed missions returned lunar rocks that have been used to develop a detailed geological understanding of the Moon's origins,
                internal structure, and subsequent history.

            <a href="http://"></a>
            <p>
                Isotope dating of lunar samples suggests the Moon formed around 50 million years after the origin of the Solar System.[35][36] Historically, several formation mechanisms have been proposed,[37] but none satisfactorily explained the features of the Earth-Moon
                system. A fission of the Moon from Earth's crust through centrifugal force[38] would require too great an initial rotation rate of Earth.[39] Gravitational capture of a pre-formed Moon[40] depends on an unfeasibly extended atmosphere of
                Earth to dissipate the energy of the passing Moon.[39] A co-formation of Earth and the Moon together in the primordial accretion disk does not explain the depletion of metals in the Moon. None of these hypotheses can account for the high
                angular momentum of the Earth-Moon system.</p>

            <p>The evolution of the Moon and a tour of the Moon</p>
            <p>The prevailing theory is that the Earth-Moon system formed after a giant impact of a Mars-sized bod</p>y (named Theia) with the proto-Earth. The impact blasted material into orbit about the Earth and then the material accreted and formed the
            Moon just beyond the Earth's Roche limit</p>

            <p>Giant impacts are thought to have been common in the early Solar System. Computer simulations of giant impacts have produced results that are consistent with the mass of the lunar core and the angular momentum of the Earth-Moon system. These
                simulations show that most of the Moon derived from the impactor, rather than the proto-Earth.[45] However, more recent simulations suggest a larger fraction of the Moon derived from the proto-Earth.[46][47][48][49] Other bodies of the
                inner Solar System such as Mars and Vesta have, according to meteorites from them, very different oxygen and tungsten isotopic compositions compared to Earth. However, Earth and the Moon have nearly identical isotopic compositions. The
                isotopic equalization of the Earth-Moon system might be explained by the post-impact mixing of the vaporized material that formed the two,[50] although this is debated.</p>

            <p>The impact released energy and then the released material re-accreted into the Earth-Moon system. This would have melted the outer shell of Earth, and thus formed a magma ocean.[52][53] Similarly, the newly formed Moon would have been affected
                and had its own lunar magma ocean; its depth is estimated from about 500 km (300 miles) to 1,737 km (1,079 miles).</p>

            <p>While the giant-impact theory explains many lines of evidence, some questions are still unresolved, most of which involve the Moon's composition.</p>

            <p>In 2001, a team at the Carnegie Institute of Washington reported the most precise measurement of the isotopic signatures of lunar rocks.[55] The rocks from the Apollo program had the same isotopic signature as rocks from Earth, differing from
                almost all other bodies in the Solar System. This observation was unexpected, because most of the material that formed the Moon was thought to come from Theia and it was announced in 2007 that there was less than a 1% chance that Theia
                and Earth had identical isotopic signatures.[56] Other Apollo lunar samples had in 2012 the same titanium isotopes composition as Earth,[57] which conflicts with what is expected if the Moon formed far from Earth or is derived from Theia.
                These discrepancies may be explained by variations of the giant-impact theory. For instance, a high-speed drive-by hit by the impactor allowed it to return to earth a second time but more slowly, and mix more thoroughly.[58] A hit-and-run-and-return
                scenario might be more likely

        <div style="background-color: skyblue;">

            <p>
                The Moon is a very slightly scalene ellipsoid due to tidal stretching, with its long axis displaced 30° from facing the Earth, due to gravitational anomalies from impact basins. Its shape is more elongated than current tidal forces can account for. This
                'fossil bulge' indicates that the Moon solidified when it orbited at half its current distance to the Earth, and that it is now too cold for its shape to adjust to its orbit.[60]</p>

            <p> <b> Internal structure</b>

                <p>The Moon is a differentiated body that was initially in hydrostatic equilibrium but has since departed from this condition.[62] It has a geochemically distinct crust, mantle, and core. The Moon has a solid iron-rich inner core with a radius
                    possibly as small as 240 kilometres (150 mi) and a fluid outer core primarily made of liquid iron with a radius of roughly 300 kilometres (190 mi). Around the core is a partially molten boundary layer with a radius of about 500 kilometres
                    (310 mi).[63][64] This structure is thought to have developed through the fractional crystallization of a global magma ocean shortly after the Moon's formation 4.5 billion years ago.[65]</p>

                <p>Crystallization of this magma ocean would have created a mafic mantle from the precipitation and sinking of the minerals olivine, clinopyroxene, and orthopyroxene; after about three-quarters of the magma ocean had crystallised, lower-density
                    plagioclase minerals could form and float into a crust atop.[66] The final liquids to crystallise would have been initially sandwiched between the crust and mantle, with a high abundance of incompatible and heat-producing elements.[1]
                    Consistent with this perspective, geochemical mapping made from orbit suggests a crust of mostly anorthosite.[15] The Moon rock samples of the flood lavas that erupted onto the surface from partial melting in the mantle confirm the
                    mafic mantle composition, which is more iron-rich than that of Earth.[1] The crust is on average about 50 kilometres (31 mi) thick.[1]</p>

                <p>The Moon is the second-densest satellite in the Solar System, after Io.[67] However, the inner core of the Moon is small, with a radius of about 350 kilometres (220 mi) or less,[1] around 20% of the radius of the Moon. Its composition
                    is not well understood, but is probably metallic iron alloyed with a small amount of sulfur and nickel; analyses of the Moon's time-variable rotation suggest that it is at least partly molten.[68] The pressure at the lunar core is
                    estimated to be 5 GPa (49,000 atm).[69]</p>

                <p> <b>Magnetic field</b></p>
                <p>The Moon has an external magnetic field of generally less than 0.2 nanoteslas,[70] or less than one hundred thousandth that of Earth. The Moon does not currently have a global dipolar magnetic field and only has crustal magnetization likely
                    acquired early in its history when a dynamo was still operating.[71][72] However, early in its history, 4 billion years ago, its magnetic field strength was likely close to that of Earth today.[70] This early dynamo field apparently
                    expired by about one billion years ago, after the lunar core had completely crystallized.[70] Theoretically, some of the remnant magnetization may originate from transient magnetic fields generated during large impacts through the
                    expansion of plasma clouds. These clouds are generated during large impacts in an ambient magnetic field. This is supported by the location of the largest crustal magnetizations situated near the antipodes of the giant impact basins.[73]</p>

                <p> <b>Gravitational field</b></p>

                <p>The gravitational field of the Moon has been measured through tracking the Doppler shift of radio signals emitted by orbiting spacecraft. The main lunar gravity features are mascons, large positive gravitational anomalies associated with
                    some of the giant impact basins, partly caused by the dense mare basaltic lava flows that fill those basins.[74][75] The anomalies greatly influence the orbit of spacecraft about the Moon. There are some puzzles: lava flows by themselves
                    cannot explain all of the gravitational signature, and some mascons exist that are not linked to mare volcanism.[76]</p>

                <p> <b>Surface geology</b></p>

                <p>Geological features of the Moon (near side / north pole at left, far side / south pole at right)</p>
                <p>Topography of the Moon measured from the Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter on the mission Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, referenced to a sphere of radius 1737.4 km</p>
                <p>Topography of the Moon</p>
                The topography of the Moon has been measured with laser altimetry and stereo image analysis.[77] Its most extensive topographic feature is the giant far-side South Pole–Aitken basin, some 2,240 km (1,390 mi) in diameter, the largest crater on the Moon
                and the second-largest confirmed impact crater in the Solar System.[78][79] At 13 km (8.1 mi) deep, its floor is the lowest point on the surface of the Moon.[78][80] The highest elevations of the Moon's surface are located directly to
                the northeast, which might have been thickened by the oblique formation impact of the South Pole–Aitken basin.[81] Other large impact basins such as Imbrium, Serenitatis, Crisium, Smythii, and Orientale possess regionally low elevations
                and elevated rims.[78] The far side of the lunar surface is on average about 1.9 km (1.2 mi) higher than that of the near side.[1]</p>

            <p>The discovery of fault scarp cliffs suggest that the Moon has shrunk by about 90 metres (300 ft) within the past billion years.[82] Similar shrinkage features exist on Mercury. Mare Frigoris, a basin near the north pole long assumed to be
                geologically dead, has cracked and shifted. Since the Moon doesn't have tectonic plates, its tectonic activity is slow and cracks develop as it loses heat.[83]</p>

            <p> <b>Volcanic features</b></p>
            <p>The dark and relatively featureless lunar plains, clearly seen with the naked eye, are called maria (Latin for "seas"; singular mare), as they were once believed to be filled with water;[84] they are now known to be vast solidified pools of
                ancient basaltic lava. Although similar to terrestrial basalts, lunar basalts have more iron and no minerals altered by water.[85] The majority of these lava deposits erupted or flowed into the depressions associated with impact basins.
                Several geologic provinces containing shield volcanoes and volcanic domes are found within the near side "maria".[86]</p>


            <p> <b>Evidence of young lunar volcanism</b></p>
            <p>Almost all maria are on the near side of the Moon, and cover 31% of the surface of the near side[87] compared with 2% of the far side.[88] This is likely due to a concentration of heat-producing elements under the crust on the near side, which
                would have caused the underlying mantle to heat up, partially melt, rise to the surface and erupt.[66][89][90] Most of the Moon's mare basalts erupted during the Imbrian period, 3.0–3.5 billion years ago, although some radiometrically
                dated samples are as old as 4.2 billion years.[91] As of 2003, crater counting studies of the youngest eruptions appeared to suggest they formed no earlier than 1.2 billion years ago.[92]</p>

            <p>In 2006, a study of Ina, a tiny depression in Lacus Felicitatis, found jagged, relatively dust-free features that, because of the lack of erosion by infalling debris, appeared to be only 2 million years old.[93] Moonquakes and releases of
                gas indicate continued lunar activity.[93] Evidence of recent lunar volcanism has been identified at 70 irregular mare patches, some less than 50 million years old. This raises the possibility of a much warmer lunar mantle than previously
                believed, at least on the near side where the deep crust is substantially warmer because of the greater concentration of radioactive elements.[94][95][96][97] Evidence has been found for 2–10 million years old basaltic volcanism within
                the crater Lowell,[98][99] inside the Orientale basin. Some combination of an initially hotter mantle and local enrichment of heat-producing elements in the mantle could be responsible for prolonged activities on the far side in the Orientale
                basin.[100][101]</p>

            <p>The lighter-colored regions of the Moon are called terrae, or more commonly highlands, because they are higher than most maria. They have been radiometrically dated to having formed 4.4 billion years ago, and may represent plagioclase cumulates
                of the lunar magma ocean.[91][92] In contrast to Earth, no major lunar mountains are believed to have formed as a result of tectonic events.[102]</p>

            <p>The concentration of maria on the near side likely reflects the substantially thicker crust of the highlands of the Far Side, which may have formed in a slow-velocity impact of a second moon of Earth a few tens of millions of years after the
                Moon's formation.[103][104] Alternatively, it may be a consequence of asymmetrical tidal heating when the Moon was much closer to the Earth.[105]</p>

            <p> <b>Impact craters</b></p>
            A gray, many-ridged surface from high above. The largest feature is a circular ringed structure with high walled sides and a lower central peak: the entire surface out to the horizon is filled with similar structures that are smaller and overlapping.
            Lunar crater Daedalus on the Moon's far side A major geologic process that has affected the Moon's surface is impact cratering,[106] with craters formed when asteroids and comets collide with the lunar surface. There are estimated to be roughly
            300,000 craters wider than 1 km (0.6 mi) on the Moon's near side.[107] The lunar geologic timescale is based on the most prominent impact events, including Nectaris, Imbrium, and Orientale; structures characterized by multiple rings of uplifted
            material, between hundreds and thousands of kilometers in diameter and associated with a broad apron of ejecta deposits that form a regional stratigraphic horizon.[108] The lack of an atmosphere, weather, and recent geological processes mean
            that many of these craters are well-preserved. Although only a few multi-ring basins have been definitively dated, they are useful for assigning relative ages. Because impact craters accumulate at a nearly constant rate, counting the number
            of craters per unit area can be used to estimate the age of the surface.[108] The radiometric ages of impact-melted rocks collected during the Apollo missions cluster between 3.8 and 4.1 billion years old: this has been used to propose a Late
            Heavy Bombardment period of increased impacts.[109]</p>

            <p>Blanketed on top of the Moon's crust is a highly comminuted (broken into ever smaller particles) and impact gardened surface layer called regolith, formed by impact processes. The finer regolith, the lunar soil of silicon dioxide glass, has
                a texture resembling snow and a scent resembling spent gunpowder.[110] The regolith of older surfaces is generally thicker than for younger surfaces: it varies in thickness from 10–20 km (6.2–12.4 mi) in the highlands and 3–5 km (1.9–3.1
                mi) in the maria.[111] Beneath the finely comminuted regolith layer is the megaregolith, a layer of highly fractured bedrock many kilometers thick.[112]</p>

            <p>High-resolution images from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter in the 2010s show a contemporary crater-production rate significantly higher than was previously estimated. A secondary cratering process caused by distal ejecta is thought to churn
                the top two centimeters of regolith on a timescale of 81,000 years.[113][114] This rate is 100 times faster than the rate computed from models based solely on direct micrometeorite impacts.[115]</p>

            <p> <b>Lunar swirls</b></p>

            <p>Lunar swirls at Reiner Gamma</p>
            <p>Lunar swirls are enigmatic features found across the Moon's surface. They are characterized by a high albedo, appear optically immature (i.e. the optical characteristics of a relatively young regolith), and often have a sinuous shape. Their
                shape is often accentuated by low albedo regions that wind between the bright swirls. They are located in places with enhanced surface magnetic fields and many are located at the antipodal point of major impacts. Well known swirls include
                the Reiner Gamma feature and Mare Ingenii. They are hypothesized to be areas that have been partially shielded from the solar wind, resulting in slower space weathering.[116]</p>

            <p> <b>Presence of water</b></p>
            <p>Liquid water cannot persist on the lunar surface. When exposed to solar radiation, water quickly decomposes through a process known as photodissociation and is lost to space. However, since the 1960s, scientists have hypothesized that water
                ice may be deposited by impacting comets or possibly produced by the reaction of oxygen-rich lunar rocks, and hydrogen from solar wind, leaving traces of water which could possibly persist in cold, permanently shadowed craters at either
                pole on the Moon.[117][118] Computer simulations suggest that up to 14,000 km2 (5,400 sq mi) of the surface may be in permanent shadow.[119] The presence of usable quantities of water on the Moon is an important factor in rendering lunar
                habitation as a cost-effective plan; the alternative of transporting water from Earth would be prohibitively expensive.[120]</p>

            <p>In years since, signatures of water have been found to exist on the lunar surface.[121] In 1994, the bistatic radar experiment located on the Clementine spacecraft, indicated the existence of small, frozen pockets of water close to the surface.
                However, later radar observations by Arecibo, suggest these findings may rather be rocks ejected from young impact craters.[122] In 1998, the neutron spectrometer on the Lunar Prospector spacecraft showed that high concentrations of hydrogen
                are present in the first meter of depth in the regolith near the polar regions.[123] Volcanic lava beads, brought back to Earth aboard Apollo 15, showed small amounts of water in their interior.[124]</p>

            <p>The 2008 Chandrayaan-1 spacecraft has since confirmed the existence of surface water ice, using the on-board Moon Mineralogy Mapper. The spectrometer observed absorption lines common to hydroxyl, in reflected sunlight, providing evidence of
                large quantities of water ice, on the lunar surface. The spacecraft showed that concentrations may possibly be as high as 1,000 ppm.[125] Using the mapper's reflectance spectra, indirect lighting of areas in shadow confirmed water ice
                within 20° latitude of both poles in 2018.[126] In 2009, LCROSS sent a 2,300 kg (5,100 lb) impactor into a permanently shadowed polar crater, and detected at least 100 kg (220 lb) of water in a plume of ejected material.[127][128] Another
                examination of the LCROSS data showed the amount of detected water to be closer to 155 ± 12 kg (342 ± 26 lb).[129]</p>

            <p>In May 2011, 615–1410 ppm water in melt inclusions in lunar sample 74220 was reported,[130] the famous high-titanium "orange glass soil" of volcanic origin collected during the Apollo 17 mission in 1972. The inclusions were formed during explosive
                eruptions on the Moon approximately 3.7 billion years ago. This concentration is comparable with that of magma in Earth's upper mantle. Although of considerable selenological interest, this announcement affords little comfort to would-be
                lunar colonists – the sample originated many kilometers below the surface, and the inclusions are so difficult to access that it took 39 years to find them with a state-of-the-art ion microprobe instrument.</p>

            <p>Analysis of the findings of the Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M3) revealed in August 2018 for the first time "definitive evidence" for water-ice on the lunar surface.[131][132] The data revealed the distinct reflective signatures of water-ice, as
                opposed to dust and other reflective substances.[133] The ice deposits were found on the North and South poles, although it is more abundant in the South, where water is trapped in permanently shadowed craters and crevices, allowing it
                to persist as ice on the surface since they are shielded from the sun.[131][133]</p>

            <p>In October 2020, astronomers reported detecting molecular water on the sunlit surface of the Moon by several independent spacecraft, including the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA).[134][135][136][137]</p>

            <p> <b>Surface conditions</b></p>
            <p>The surface of the Moon is an extreme environment with temperatures that range from 140 °C down to −171 °C, an atmospheric pressure of 10−10 Pa, and high levels of ionizing radiation from the Sun and cosmic rays. The exposed surfaces of spacecraft
                are considered unlikely to harbor bacterial spores after just one lunar orbit.[138] The surface gravity of the Moon is approximately 1.625 m/s2, about 16.6% that on Earth's surface or 0.166 ɡ.[4]</p>

            <p> <b>Atmosphere</b></p>

            <p>Sketch by the Apollo 17 astronauts. The lunar atmosphere was later studied by LADEE.[139][140] The Moon has an atmosphere so tenuous as to be nearly vacuum, with a total mass of less than 10 tonnes (9.8 long tons; 11 short tons).[141] The
                surface pressure of this small mass is around 3 × 10−15 atm (0.3 nPa); it varies with the lunar day. Its sources include outgassing and sputtering, a product of the bombardment of lunar soil by solar wind ions.[15][142] Elements that have
                been detected include sodium and potassium, produced by sputtering (also found in the atmospheres of Mercury and Io); helium-4 and neon[143] from the solar wind; and argon-40, radon-222, and polonium-210, outgassed after their creation
                by radioactive decay within the crust and mantle.[144][145] The absence of such neutral species (atoms or molecules) as oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, hydrogen and magnesium, which are present in the regolith, is not understood.[144] Water
                vapor has been detected by Chandrayaan-1 and found to vary with latitude, with a maximum at ~60–70 degrees; it is possibly generated from the sublimation of water ice in the regolith.[146] These gases either return into the regolith because
                of the Moon's gravity or are lost to space, either through solar radiation pressure or, if they are ionized, by being swept away by the solar wind's magnetic field.[144]</p>

            <p>Studies of Moon magma samples retrieved by the Apollo missions demonstrate that the Moon had once possessed a relatively thick atmosphere for a period of 70 million years between 3 and 4 billion years ago. This atmosphere, sourced from gases
                ejected from lunar volcanic eruptions, was twice the thickness of that of present-day Mars. The ancient lunar atmosphere was eventually stripped away by solar winds and dissipated into space.[147]</p>

            <p> <b>Dust</b></p>
            <p>A permanent Moon dust cloud exists around the Moon, generated by small particles from comets. Estimates are 5 tons of comet particles strike the Moon's surface every 24 hours, resulting in the ejection of dust particles. The dust stays above
                the Moon approximately 10 minutes, taking 5 minutes to rise, and 5 minutes to fall. On average, 120 kilograms of dust are present above the Moon, rising up to 100 kilometers above the surface. Dust counts made by LADEE's Lunar Dust EXperiment
                (LDEX) found particle counts peaked during the Geminid, Quadrantid, Northern Taurid, and Omicron Centaurid meteor showers, when the Earth, and Moon pass through comet debris. The lunar dust cloud is asymmetric, being more dense near the
                boundary between the Moon's dayside and nightside.[148][149]</p>

            <p> <b>Size and mass</b></p>

            <p>The Moon and selected moons of the Solar System, with Earth to scale. Nineteen moons are large enough to be round, several having subsurface oceans and one, Titan, having a considerable atmosphere. The Moon is by size and mass the fifth largest
                natural satellite of the Solar System, categorizeable as one of its planetary-mass moons. It is smaller than Mercury and considerably larger than the largest dwarf planet of the Solar System, Pluto. While the minor-planet moon Charon of
                the Pluto-Charon system is larger relative to Pluto,[g][150] the Moon is the largest natural satellite of the Solar System relative to their primary planets.[h]</p>

            <p>The Moon's diameter is about 3,500 km, more than a quarter of Earth's, with the face of the Moon comparable to the width of Australia.[16] The whole surface area of the Moon is about 38 million square kilometers, slightly less than the area
                of the Americas (North and South America).</p>

            <p>The Moon's mass is 1/81 of Earth's,[87] being the second densest among the planetary moons, having the second highest surface gravity, after Io, at 0.1654 g and an escape velocity of 2.38 km/s (8600 km/h; 5300 mph).</p>
